## Duration Picker
Duration Picker lets you easily select how long something will go on for without having to switch focus from the keyboard. This approach eliminates the need for dropdowns and autoformats user input on pressing Enter. You could use this to set an interval workout beep to go off after every 1 minute, or set your bedtime playlist to pause in 30 minutes from when it starts and so on.

## Examples

* 1030 -> 10:30
* 130 -> 1:30
* 12 -> 12:00
* 1 -> 1:00
* 7000 -> Invalid
* 12345 -> Invalid

Valid input for this implementation is minimum of 00:05 and maximum of 59:59. Can be easily tweaked to fit different needs.

## Motivation

There are plenty of great timepickers out there, but I couldn't find a good duration picker for the project I was working on. Created this as a result and I figured it could help someone!
