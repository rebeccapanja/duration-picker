        <h1>Duration picker</h1>

        <h3>What is a duration picker?</h3>
        <p>Duration Picker lets you select fixed time periods. You can choose how long something will go on for, not relative to a date. This particular project experiments with auto formatting user inputs instead of using a traditional dropdown.</p>

        <h3>What are some examples where I could use this?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Set your bedtime playlist to stop 30 minutes from start.</li>
          <li>Setup beeps for your interval workout.</li>
          <li>For a timed test or interview.</li>
          <li>Give you reminders x minutes before your calendar event.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And so on. This is not a library yet, but a component to incorporate as part of a bigger project!</p>

        <h3>How is this different from the rest?</h3>
        <p>The obvious choice for a picker would be a dropdown but this project experiments with keeping the user's focus on their keyboard. This approach eliminates the need for clicking a dropdown, scrolling to find your option and instead  auto-formats your input on pressing Enter.</p>
        <p>Also, a quick Google search will reveal that while there are plenty of datepicker and timepicker options, there is no good duration picker and that's how this project came about.</p>

        <h3>How does it work? Why does it work this way?</h3>
        <p>This was built for min:sec format. Its easy to imagine that when i type 1030, I would want it to show as 10:30. The trickier one was 3 digits like 130. Is that 1:30 or 13:00? For the scenario I was working with, it was far more likely that the user meant 1:30 and not 13 so that's the approach I decided to go with. Obviously, these can be easily tweaked to fit another project's needs.</p>
        
        <h3>Demo</h3>
        <p>Input some digits and hit Enter.</p>
        <input type="text" name="break_length_readable" placeholder="00:00" data-time-input data-parsley-trigger="change" data-parsley-regex=''/>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>Here are a few example of what the user inputs turns to on pressing Enter key.</p>
